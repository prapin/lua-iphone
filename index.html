<h1>Lua for iPhone</h1>

<p>Version 5.1.4-1</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.</p>

<p>Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. 
Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. </p>

<p>Lua for iPhone is a console distribution of Lua for jailbroken iPhones, that can be run interactively using
a SSH connection or MobileTerminal, or through scripts files just like Bash shell scripts.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>Lua for iPhone is available as a .deb package through Cydia. The package installs the main interpreter executable
<code>lua</code>, a compiler interface <code>luac</code>, and a few common libraries. </p>

<p>The interpreter as been patched to support completion using Readline, so try to press the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key 
to obtain a list of matching words in the context. Please note however that the completion list
is just a cue and is by no mean exhaustive.</p>
